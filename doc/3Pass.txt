INTRODUCTION                                                  *3pass*

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes. The first
pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp
the paper's content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand
the paper in depth.

================================================================================
FIRST PASS                                                    *first-pass*

The first pass is a quick scan to get an overview. You can also decide whether
you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes.

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already
   read.

At the end of first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an
   existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. Content: Which other papers is it related to? Which theorectical bases were
   used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

================================================================================
SECOND PASS                                                   *second-pass*

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as
proofs.

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations. Pay special
   attention to graphs. Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions
   are statistically significant?
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading.

The second pass should take upto an hour. After this pass, you should be able to
grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust
of the paper with supporting evidence.

This is a good point to pause and read more background material if needed.

================================================================================
THIRD PASS                                                    *third-pass*

The key to the third pass is to attempt to virually re-implement the paper: that
is making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing
this re-creation with the actual paper you can easily identify not only a
paper's innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. You
should think how you yourself would present a particular idea.

This comparison lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques
in the paper and you can likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During
this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners and about an hour for
an experienced reader. At the end of this pass, you should be able to
reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to
identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to
pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential
issues with experiment or analytical techniques.

================================================================================
DOING A LITERATURE SURVEY				      *literature-survey*

Paper reading skills are put to test in doing a literature survey. This will
require you to read tens of papers, perhaps in an unfamiliar field. What papers
should you read?

First, use an academic search engine like Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some
well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area. Do one
pass on each paper to get a sense of th ework, and read their related work
sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, a
pointer to a recent survey paper.

Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names
in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area.
Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of key
researchers and see where they've published recently. That will help you
identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually
publish in the top conferences.

The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and loop
through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent
high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside
earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through
these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain
and read it, iterating as necessary.
